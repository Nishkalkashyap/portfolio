<Header />

## Introduction

Created the [Quark software](https://quarkjs.io). A full fledged application development and distribution platform for Windows, Mac and Linux based operating systems. 

Since it's [public announcement](https://medium.com/hackernoon/announcing-quark-a-software-sketchbook-for-your-projects-2f53553415b) in August 2019, the project website has been <strong>viewed over 115,000 times</strong> and the [Quark software](https://quarkjs.io) itself has been downloaded by <strong>over 10,000 users</strong> around the world.













## Quark development environment
Quark development environment is powered by the same code editor as of <strong>Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</strong>.

The IDE is cross-platform, and boasts of features like an integrated terminal,
multiple theme support, more than 150 different editor settings, an inbuilt package manager,
and a fully-configurable build system <i>(webpack)</i>.

## Documentation, DevOps, E2E testing and Status page
Quark follows all the best practices of software development, has a neat documentation coupled with continuous integration and end-to-end tests on Travis CI. 

The software also boasts of novel features like 'automatic-updates' with multiple release channels namely 'stable', 'insiders' and 'nightly' release. 

Also, in case of service disruption, Quark has a status page that users can subscribe to via email, and get notified on the issue.
