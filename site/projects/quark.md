# Quark

<Header />

## Introduction

Created the [Quark software](https://quarkjs.io). A full fledged application development and distribution platform for Windows, Mac and Linux based operating systems. 

Since it's [public announcement](https://medium.com/hackernoon/announcing-quark-a-software-sketchbook-for-your-projects-2f53553415b) in August 2019, the project website has been <strong>viewed over 115,000 times</strong> and the [Quark software](https://quarkjs.io) itself has been downloaded by <strong>over 10,000 users</strong> around the world.













## Quark development environment
Quark development environment is powered by the same code editor as of <strong>Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</strong>.

The IDE is cross-platform, and boasts of features like an integrated terminal,
multiple theme support, more than 150 different editor settings, an inbuilt package manager,
and a fully-configurable build system <i>(webpack)</i>.

## Quark App store
Currently under active development. [Quark appstore](https://dash.quarkjs.io) is a full-fledged application sharing platform. 

Once completed, users will be able to create, share, download and monetize applications on Quark app store. The aim of the app store is to help open-source developers to build and monetize their creations.

This project is fully open-sourced on [GitHub.](https://github.com/Nishkalkashyap/Quark-appstore)

## Documentation, DevOps, E2E testing and Status page
Quark follows all the best practices of software development, has a neat documentation coupled with continuous integration and end-to-end tests on Travis CI. 

The software also boasts of novel features like 'automatic-updates' with multiple release channels namely 'stable', 'insiders' and 'nightly' release. 

Also, in case of service disruption, Quark has a status page that users can subscribe to via email, and get notified on the issue.
