### Working

Build with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Processing](https://processing.org), this data acquisition system handles more that 20 different sensors.

The data is sent in real time via a radio transmitter mounted on the car and received on the client side via a receiver connected to a laptop.
