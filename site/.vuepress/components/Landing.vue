    <Timeline timeline="Born - September 22, 1996 - 22 years old" heading="Here's what I'm all about" id="about" content="
      I'm a Mechanical Engineer developing new technologies, building things, blogging, promoting sustainability, and heralding entrepreneurship.
      I am particularly fascinated with multi-disciplinary engineering.
      To this end, I have undertaken a plethora of projects spanning a wide variety of disciplines including combustion powertrain engineering, mechanics, electronics, web development and software engineering.
      Furthermore, I have also been a part of several inter-disciplinary student teams at university, particularly the Formula Student initiative at Delhi Technological University.
      I believe that creative engineering is indistinguishable from fine artwork.

    <Timeline timeline="2018 - Present" heading="Quark" content="
      I started this project while I was pursuing my degree in mechanical engineering
      and got really frustrated with the fact that there were hardly any tools on the software side that would make my life easier,
      just to do simple things like plot scientific charts, IoT development, create dashboards etc.
      <br/><br/> 
      After realizing the commercial potential of a project like this, I decided to build this software tool myself.

        Simply Said: Quark is an <strong>integrated development environment(IDE)</strong> and a <strong>JavaScript runtime</strong>.
        You write your code in the IDE and press a button to build your project. Thatâ€™s all!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The IDE automatically takes care of transpiling and bundling the project behind the scenes and outputs a Quark app.
        Quark apps are cross-platform and run on <strong>MacOS, Linux and Windows.</strong>

        Quark IDE is built on the top of the same code editor as of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
        This means Quark has out of the box support for things like intelligent code completions,'go to definitions', 'replace occurrences' e.t.c

        <br/>
        On top of that, Quark also boasts of other features like an integrated terminal,
        multiple theme support, more than 150 different editor settings, an inbuilt package manager,
        and a fully-configurable build system <i>(webpack)</i>.
