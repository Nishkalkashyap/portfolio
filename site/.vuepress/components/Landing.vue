      content="
      I'm a Mechanical Engineer developing new technologies, building things, blogging, promoting sustainability, and heralding entrepreneurship.
      I am particularly fascinated with multi-disciplinary engineering.
      To this end, I have undertaken a plethora of projects spanning a wide variety of disciplines including combustion powertrain engineering, mechanics, electronics, web development and software engineering.
      Furthermore, I have also been a part of several inter-disciplinary student teams at university, particularly the Formula Student initiative at Delhi Technological University.
      I believe that creative engineering is indistinguishable from fine artwork.

      content="
      I started this project while I was persuing my degree in mechanical engineering
      and got really frustrated with the fact that there were hardly any tools on the software side that would make my life easier,
      just to do simple things like plot scientific charts, IoT development, create dashboards etc.
      <br/><br/> 
      After realizing the commercial potential of a project like this, I decided to build this software tool myself.
