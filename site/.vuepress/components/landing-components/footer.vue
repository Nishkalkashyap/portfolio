        Your time is limited,
        so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
        Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.
        Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.
        And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
        They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
        Everything else is secondary.

      <p class="quote">
        Deep in the sea
        all molecules repeat
        the patterns of one another
        till complex new ones are formed.
        They make others like themselves
        and a new dance starts.
        Growing in size and complexity
        living things
        masses of atoms
        DNA, protein
        dancing a pattern ever more intricate.
        Out of the cradle
        onto dry land
        here it is
        standing:
        atoms with consciousness;
        matter with curiosity.
        Stands at the sea,
        wonders at wondering: I
        a universe of atoms
        an atom in the Universe.
