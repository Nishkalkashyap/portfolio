Hello,

I'm a self driven engineer pursuing multi-disciplinary engineering.

To this end, I have undertaken a plethora of projects spanning a wide variety of disciplines including web development, software engineering, combustion powertrain engineering, mechanics and electronics.

Furthermore, I have also been a part of several inter-disciplinary student teams at university and participated in several international competitions, leading a team of 25 student engineers.

I'm deeply passionate about research and development, I hope I could find a place in your company.

Highly recommend visiting my portfolio website at: nishkal.in

Thanks and Regards
Nishkal Kashyap
