# Variable geometry intake manifold

<Header />

## Introduction
An intake manifold is simply a mechanical component attached to the engines cylinder head that allows the air/fuel mixture to enter the combustion chamber of the engine. The intake manifold consists of following parts:

#### What is Variable geometry intake manifold?
Short answer, to achieve greater Volumetric efficiency. As a consequence of greater volumetric efficiency, we can achieve greater torque, power and thermal efficiency from the same size of the engine at the same RPM.

#### What is Volumetric efficiency?
Volumetric efficiency in an internal combustion engine, is defined as the ratio of the mass density of the air-fuel mixture drawn into the cylinder at atmospheric pressure (during the intake stroke) to the mass density of the same volume of air in the intake manifold. 

#### DIY-Variable geometry intake manifold: 
The design consists of the following components, arranged in the direction downstream to the air flow:

1. __Design__: The design consists of the following components, arranged in the direction downstream to the air flow:

   1. __Throttle Body__: Contains the throttle position sensor and connects the butterfly valve to the throttle actuation cable.
   2. __Venturi (Or air restrictor in case of FSAE)__: The smallest path in the intake manifold.
   3. __Actuation Cable__: connects the Movable Ram to the servo.
   4. __Upper Plenum Cap__: makes the upper part of the plenum and contains the mounts for actuation     cable and pressure sensor. It connects to the plenum drum via screw threads. 
   5. __Plenum Drum__: Connects the upper and lower plenum. 
   6. __Movable Ram__: Moves inside the plenum drum to control the plenum volume and runner length.
   7. __Lower Plenum Cap__:makes the lower part of the plenum and contains the mounts for actuation     cable and pressure sensor. It connects to the plenum drum via screw threads. 
   8. __Pressure Sensor__: Is used to measure pressure at different parts of the intake.
   9. __Fuel Delivery system__: Made up of fuel injector and fuel delivery lines from the fuel tank.
